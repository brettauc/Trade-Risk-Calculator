1. Complete code for get risk amount for trade part (started 10/7)
    - [x] Add message if ticker symbol is not in the dictionary (completed 10/8)
        - not using this: my new plan is populate a searchable menu in the dashboard. if the ticker symbol is not in the dictionary it will not return a value to be selected
    - [x] Determined it was better to use point value rather than tick size and per tick $ amount (completed 10/8)
        - decided to use point values to allow for a more simplistic dictionary structure
    - [x] create a function with the completed code (completed 10/8)
     
2. Start get stop loss target for trade (started 10/8/2020)
    - [x] Determine if need tick size and value to do this (completed 10/8)
        - was able to get the desired output with the values that were input
    - [x] Determine how to handle if trade is a short side trade (completed 10/8)
            * accomplished with a simple if/then statement
    - [x] Figure out how to allow for different float value outputs depending on the actual output value (completed 10/12)
            * using rounding to 8 decimal points as that is the most there should be and zeros will drop off.
            * update(10/15) - figured out how to print the exact amount of decimals basd on the tick_size
    - [x] create a function with the completed code (completed 10/8)

3. Create dashboard
    - [x] Determine what to use: panel, Flask, or Django (completed 10/12)
            - decided to use panel as I'm familar with it
    - [ ] this would need to be updated to include Flask or Django code to be deployed to Heroku or AWS
        
4. Create tKinter gui and convert to a .exe file.(started 10/15)
    - [] exit_price, risk_per_contract, total_risk variable need to be reset to floats and/or int after calculate button is pressed
    - [] create message box if the total risk is not a multiple of the tick_size
    - [] allow for auto-sizing of the window
    
5. Add new items to dictionary
    - [x] Add micro contracts to dictionary(ie:MES, MNQ, MYM, etc) (completed 10/13)
    - [ ] VOLQ future
    
6. Switch back to using tick size and tick value instead of point value (completed 10/15)
    - [x] this may be needed for the "get stop loss target for trade" so that it can calculate stop loss target by ticks and not points.
 
7. Determine how/where to put application online
    - [ ] AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku
            - Have decided to use Heroku. Need to look into directions on how to deploy app to this.
            
Bugs
1. [x]Panel does not switch to the trade_stop_loss function when the "Get" value is changed
